# Assignment 3 & 4: Critique by Design

## Exisiting data visualization

This chart is showing the top 10 most in-demand developer skills of 2013 by calculating from the search number. 
I select this chart because I found that the information is related to the field that I'm studying, which is Technology.
Moreover, this is my first time seeing the use of a linear graph to explain the proportion of data. This chart is super counterintuitive. Therefore, I think there should be room for me to redesign and make it better.

Noted that I found this interesting chart through Google search. Therefore, I only know that it is from readwrite.com but cannot refer to specific article.

## Process of critique and redesign

### Critique process

By going through Data Visualization Effectiveness Profile, Intuitiveness, Truthfulness, and Perceptability are three concepts that led me to think about the redesign the most. Here are some insights that I found and want to make changes.
1. Intuitiveness: This chart is very difficult to understand since some symbols are not clearly labeled. Moreover, a linear graph is usually used to display change over time as a series of data points connected by a line whereas it does not apply to the percentage proportion.
2. Truthfulness: By distributed the percentage evenly without followed the actual precision in X-axis, create confusion for me. It inaccurately represents the data. 
3. Perceptibility: Using a linear graph to represent the proportion percentage is misleading. It is hard to understand that there is no meaning regarding the location of symbols whether it is above or below the line.

### Redesign and evaluation process

I choose to wireframe a solution into two different graph types.
1. Bar chart
2. Pie chart

I also design on how to use the colors which are
1. Different colors to represent the different types of programing language 
2. Same colors or maybe different shades to keep the graph clean and simple.

Therefore, I am mixing the chart type and color usage, which resulted in 4 different styles of the chart. The headline for all charts also has changed to be more concise. Also, the symbols are replaced with the programming language name to avoid confusion in a wider group of audiences. Then I present all those charts and ask for feedback. The general feedback is very good. People understand the core message of the graph immediately and did not found any major confusion in these new redesign charts.

The two popular charts that people selected are a pie chart using a different set of colors and a bar chart using the same color(the final chart that will shown in the next section).

According to feedback, people still think that this pie chart contains too much color. Additionally, it is hard to spot the differences of percentage through the pie size since it is pretty similar, so it is not pop out immediately.

While for the bar chart, which will see in the next section is easier to understand since the bars are sort from the highest to lowest percentage.  Besides, using only one color made the graph cleaner. That is why we select the bar chart for our final chart.
