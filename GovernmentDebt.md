# Government Debt visualization

These 3 visualization is based on the general government debt information of OECD countries.

Information source: National Accounts at a Glance

## Visualization 1: Bar chart 

This bar chart is originally from the OECD website. 
The chart shows the debt of each country in the year 2018.

## Visualization 2: Line chart 

This line chart shows the debt of each country separately during 1995-2019.
I also added the title, description text, and source of information on top of the original design.

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/4272729"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

## Visualization 3: Dot plot

I choose dot plot to represent the debt information because it can show the data in 3 dimensions.

1. X-axis: to display the time period
2. Y-axis: to display each country name
3. Sizes of the dot: to represent the value of deb-to-GDP ratio

### Critique

For the bar chart, it cannot show the data in a time-series format due to the restriction of the graph design. Moreover, there is not sufficient context provided about the interpretation and meaning of this debt information. So, it is a bit hard to understand the chart.

For the line chart, it is easy to understand the trend of Debt-to-GDP ratio for each country during a time period because the graphs are shown separately. However, it is hard if you want to compare this ratio county-by-county each year. Additionally, the title and description that I added could be more concise and meaningful.

The dot plot is an evolvement of my understanding of the data and the problems, which occurred in the previous chart. In this graph, it can show both the Debt-to-GDP ratio for each country during a time period and also county-by-county comparison. I also edited the title and description to add more specific detail such as the year of the data. Besides, I add the description of dot sizes to avoid misunderstanding. Last but not least, I use the same colors across the chart because I don't want to create confusion since I already use different sizes of the dot.
