This is my public portfolio for the Telling Stories with Data class at CMU!

# About me
My name is Chanya Jirakawinvanich :)

Currently, I am studying for my master's degree at Carnegie Mellon University in Information System Management. I have finished my undergraduate degree back in my home country, Thailand, at Chulalongkorn University in Information and Communication Engineering.

After graduating from CMU this December, I hope to work on a job where I can leverage both technical as well as business knowledge in order to create an impact on both the community and company. 

In my free time, I love to play drum sets and travel.  


# What I hope to learn
I hope to learn how to turn data into a visualization that can communicate to people in a simple and understandable way.
