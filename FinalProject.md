# Final Project 

## Part I

### Outline
<u>The objective of this project:</u>

This project will talk about the aging society trend that is rising in Thailand (my home country). I want to raise awareness to the younger generation about the impact of this unrealized trend and how we can help to build a better society for the elderly.

<u>Project structure:</u>

I want to portray this story in a top-down approach starting from the aging society trend around the world then move to Asia and Thailand. I will talk about the life expectancy of people, population by age group, dependency ratio. Next, I will include the birth rate and death rate as well. After people are aware of this upcoming trend, I will move to the impact part that illustrates how this trend affects society. Lastly, my call to action will divide into two parts. Firstly, I want the readers to go back and take good care of their parents that are getting older every day. Secondly, I hope that the readers will reach out and help an organization or nursing home that takes care of the homeless elderly.

### Initial sketches

In this storytelling project, I plan to use several charts.

1. Map: To show the changes of aging society trend around the world and in Asia
2. Line chart: To show the aging society trend in Thailand over a period of time, birth rate and death rate of Thai people
3. Pie chart/ Donut chart: To show population by age group, dependency ratio over a period of time
4. Number and Icon: To show the life expectancy

### Data

Below is the data that is used for visualization.
All of these data will be downloaded into excel/CSV file and uploaded to create a visualization.

### Method and medium

I plan to use 'Shorthand' as the main storytelling tool. Apart from the text section, I will integrate media such as the chart created by 'Flourish.studio', pictures, and videos to enrich the experience of my readers.

* Page 1: This page aims to grab user attention through a catchy word as well as a strong appearance of elder.
* Page 2: Through a top-down approach, this first graph portrays a big picture of this story, which is the rising world aging society trend. I want to raise awareness that this trend is something very close to everyone and might affect the reader in the short term.
* Page 3: On this page, I want to focus on the aging society in Thailand. The graph shows the significant increase in the older generation over the prediction in the future.
* Page 4: Then, the story will dig deep into the population by age group in Thailand during 2009-2019 as well as the dependency ratio. The support context here will highlight that the working-age will need to work harder since they need to support the rise of the elderly group. Moreover, the number of working-age will decrease in contrast to the elder that increased.
* Page 5: This page will emphasize that this trend will last long due to the drop in birth rate as well as the rise in the birth rate. Also, this page will show the life expectancy of people in Thailand. Noted that life expectancy will disply using icon and number while birth/death rate will use line chart.
* Page 6: On this page, it will summarize the impact of the aging society. So, it can smoothly lead to the call-to-action on the next page.
* Page 7: My first call-to-action will focus on a personal level, which is for the reader to go back and take good care of their parents that are getting older every day.
* Page 8: This last page will talk about the second call-to-action, which is for a reader to reach out and help an organization or nursing home that takes care of the homeless elderly.

### User research and interviews

#### Target Audience

| Audience  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Target Audience | * Resident citizen of Thailand who is during their working-age, which is 15-64 years old especially who have an elderly in their family.|
| Interviewee detail  | * A male MBA student, 27 years old. * A male PhD (Human computer interaction) student, 31 years old * A female Heinz (Public policy) student, 33 years old.|
| Criteria for selecting interviewee  | <ul><li>All my interviewees are from Thailand since this story wants to raise awareness of an aging problem that occurred in Thailand.</li><li>I try to diversify their academic background, so the feedback comes from a different perspective; business aspects, policy aspects, technology aspects.</li></ul>|


#### Research goal 

| Goal  | Question | Feedback |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Relevance of the information | 	<ul><li>How each topic connect to each other?</li><li>Do this piece of information is required and support the storyline?</li></ul>| <ul><li>Each topic support the other well.</li><li> The dependency ratio is redundant to the population by age group. Also, the dependency ratio calculates using (people who 0-14 years old + 65 years and older) / (Working age which is 15-64 years old). The calculation is confusing because it is not only the relationship between older and working people. The result can bias toward the additional percentage from the younger generation.</li></ul> |
| Emotional appeal  | <ul><li>Do the first page grab your attention?</li><li>What is the overall tone of this story</li></ul>| <ul><li>The image and wording on the first page show the sadness and suffering of a man regarding this issue and aging problem.</li><li> The overall tone is serious and urges the urgency of this urgency.</li></ul>|
| Comprehension  | <ul><li>Do you have any questions about the data presented?</li><li>Did you find any graphics confusing?</li></ul>| <ul><li>The label in the x-axis on a line chart in storyboard page 3 can change from 2020* to 2020e since it is a universal form to represent the projected number.</li><li>The color used for the working-age group on a donut chart in storyboard page 4 can change to more vivid color. Since the purpose of this graph is to compare between working-age and older people, however, the reader can see only the elder group right now.</li></ul>|
| Intention  | <ul><li>Would you aware that you need to go back and take good care of your parents that are getting older every day?</li><li>Would you reach out and help an organization or nursing home that takes care of the homeless elderly?</li></ul>| <ul><li>For the intention part, the reader said that the given call-to-action is restricted and somehow unrelatable to him. Although the story is convincing, he is hardly doing the call-to-action.The reader said that this story shouldn't limit to only two call-to-action. He suggested that it could leave as an open-end question, where the author can provide 3-4 call-to-action options and let the readers should the one that they want to do.</li></ul> |
| Improvement  | <ul><li>What would you change about this story?</li></ul>  | <ul><li>Apart from the above feedback, the interviewee suggested that there should be one page before page 3 to grab users' attention, that now we are going to focus on Thailand issues and Why we select Thailand out of all 50 countries show on the previous page.</li></ul> |

The changes I am plan on implementing to my final visualizations is from the above feedback column.
