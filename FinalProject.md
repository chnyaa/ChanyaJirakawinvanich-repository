# Final Project 

## Part I

### Outline
<u>The objective of this project:</u>
This project will talk about the aging society trend that is rising in Thailand (my home country). I want to raise awareness to the younger generation about the impact of this unrealized trend and how we can help to build a better society for the elderly.

<u>Project structure:</u>
I want to portray this story in a top-down approach starting from the aging society trend around the world then move to Asia and Thailand. I will talk about the population by age group, dependency ratio. Next, I will highlight the life expectancy of people, the birth rate, and the death rate. After people are aware of this upcoming trend, I will move to the impact part that illustrates how this trend affects society. Lastly, my call to action will divide into two parts. Firstly, I want the readers to go back and take good care of their parents that are getting older every day. Secondly, I hope that the readers will reach out and help an organization or nursing home that takes care of the homeless elderly.
