# Final Project 

## Part I

### Outline
<u>The objective of this project:</u>

This project will talk about the aging society trend that is rising in Thailand (my home country). I want to raise awareness to the younger generation about the impact of this unrealized trend and how we can help to build a better society for the elderly.

<u>Project structure:</u>

I want to portray this story in a top-down approach starting from the aging society trend around the world then move to Asia and Thailand. I will talk about the life expectancy of people, population by age group, dependency ratio. Next, I will include the birth rate and death rate as well. After people are aware of this upcoming trend, I will move to the impact part that illustrates how this trend affects society. Lastly, my call to action will divide into two parts. Firstly, I want the readers to go back and take good care of their parents that are getting older every day. Secondly, I hope that the readers will reach out and help an organization or nursing home that takes care of the homeless elderly.

<u>Initial sketches:</u>

In this storytelling project, I plan to use several charts.

1. Map: To show the changes of aging society trend around the world and in Asia
2. Line chart: To show the aging society trend in Thailand over a period of time, birth rate and death rate of Thai people
3. Pie chart/ Donut chart: To show population by age group, dependency ratio over a period of time
4. Number and Icon: To show the life expectancy 

<u>Data:</u>

Below is the data that is used for visualization.
All of these data will be downloaded into excel/CSV file and uploaded to create a visualization.

<u>Method and medium:</u>

I plan to use 'Shorthand' as the main storytelling tool. Apart from the text section, I will integrate media such as the chart created by 'Flourish.studio', pictures, and videos to enrich the experience of my readers.
